# PIR motion sensing

Description:
Pyroelectric infrared motion sensor can detect infrared signals from a moving person or moving animal, and output switching signals. It can be applied to a variety of occasions to detect the movement of human body. Conventional pyroelectric infrared sensors require body pyroelectric infrared detector, professional chip and complex peripheral circuit, so the size is much more bigger, with complex circuit and lower reliability. Now we launch this new pyroelectric infrared motion sensor, specially designed for Arduino. It uses an integrated digital body pyroelectric infrared sensor, with smaller size, higher reliability, lower power consumption and simpler peripheral circuit.

Specification:

- Input Voltage: 3.3 ~ 5V, Maximum for 6V
