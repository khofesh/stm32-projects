how to trigger the sensor: move your hand at certain speed closer to the sensor

Introduction:
Infrared obstacle detector sensor is equipped with distance adjustment function and is especially designed for wheeled robots. This sensor has strong adaptability to ambient light and is of high precision. It has a pair of infrared transmitting and receiving tube. When infrared ray launched by the transmitter tube encounters an obstacle (its reflector), the infrared ray will be reflected to the receiver tube, thus the indicator will light up, and signal output interface outputs digital signal. In addition, you can rotate the potentiometer knob to adjust detection distance ( effective distance: 2 ～ 40cm, working Voltage: 3.3V-5V ). Thanks to a wide voltage range, this sensor can work steadily even under fluctuating power supply voltage and is suitable for the use of various micro-controllers, Arduino controllers and BS2 controllers. A robot mounted with this sensor can sense obstaclein the environment.
